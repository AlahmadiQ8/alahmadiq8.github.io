Welcome to my archive—a collection of my earliest blog posts dating back to 2018. I’ve kept these posts here intentionally, as a reminder of where I started and how far I’ve come.

Writing in a second language wasn’t always easy, and my skills were still a work in progress. But I believe there’s no shame in showing the rough beginnings. In fact, I’m proud of the growth and improvement you’ll see over time.

Everyone starts somewhere, and I hope these early posts encourage anyone who’s hesitant to share their own work or take the first step. Thanks for being part of the journey.
