title: Why I keep writing
toc: false
---

As I progress in my career as a software engineer, I find my self needing to write more. I create slide decks, give trainings, write documentations and proposals. Hence, I see first hand how strong written communication serves my career. On a personal level, here's why I keep writing:

* I want to better communicate and put my thoughts together cohesively to share with others.
* Sometimes, I just want to understand my own thoughts.
* Reflect back on my writing and observe how I grew.

I do try, although reluctantly, to publish my writing despite my insecurity. Inspired by [Show Your Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Show-Your-Work-Getting-Discovered/dp/076117897X), I want to increase my odds of being discovered, connecting with others with shared interest, and to keep myself motivated to continuously improve.
