title: Resources Technical Writing For Software Engineers
toc: false
---

I wanted to improve my technical writing skills and searched online with "technical writing for software engineers". [Google's technical writing courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview) was the first result and I immediately jumped into it.

I finished the courses and they now belong to my must-read resources. It ticks a lot of aha moments about technical writing. Google strongly stress that documentation is part of software development. And from my experience in the industry, this couldn't be more true.

Below are technical writing resources I want to save for later:
- [Google's developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/)
- [GitLab's Technical Writing Fundamentals](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/fundamentals/)
